ACCESSIBILITY PLAN 
 
Assistive Devices 
 
CarltonOne Engagement will ensure that its staff is trained and familiar with various assistive devices that 
may be used by customers with disabilities while accessing our goods or services. 

Persons  with  disabilities  may  use  their  own  assistive  devices  as  required  when  accessing  goods  and 
services at any CarltonOne Engagement location. 

In cases where the assistive device presents a safety concern or where accessibility might be an issue, 
other reasonable measures will be used to ensure the access of goods and services. 

Communication 
 
CarltonOne  Engagement  will  communicate  with  people  with  disabilities  in  ways  that  consider  their 
disability. 

  Train employees to be aware of signs of communications problems; 
  Asking the person how they would like to be communicated with; 
  Communicate with person with a disability in a manner that considers his/her disability. 

Service Animals 
 
We welcome people with disabilities and their service animals. Service animals are allowed on the parts 
of our premises (in Ontario) that are open to the public. 
 
Support Persons 

If a customer with a disability is accompanied by a support person, CarltonOne Engagement will ensure 
that both persons can enter the premises and the customer will not be prevented from having full access 
to the support person. In situations where confidential information might be discussed, consent will first 
be obtained from the customer, prior to any such conversation or disclosure. 

Fees will not be charged for support persons. In the event a third party is hosting an event and charging 
fees for the event, the support person will be allowed to attend the event at their own cost, unless not 
required by the third party. 
 
Should this situation change in the future, we will notify customers of this through a notice posted on our 
premises and at the time of booking any appointments.
